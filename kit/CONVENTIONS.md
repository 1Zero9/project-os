# Conventions

Standing rules for anything built under 1Zero9. Short by design — a convention
earns a place here only when forgetting it would mean going back and redoing
work. Apply them without being asked.

## Every site carries a build credit

In the footer of any site built for or by 1Zero9:

```
Built by 1Zero9 → https://www.1zero9.com
```

Alongside whatever else the footer says. Add a test for it where the project
has a test suite, so it cannot quietly disappear in a redesign.

## Every finished site goes in the portfolio

The portfolio is `~/Projects/1Zero9Studio`, on Vercel, deploying from `main`.
Projects are MDX in `content/projects/<slug>/index.mdx`, following
`content/projects/_template/index.mdx`.

To add one:

1. Write `content/projects/<slug>/index.mdx` — frontmatter plus The idea /
   The build / Why it matters.
2. Screenshot the live site at 1440×900 to
   `public/images/projects/<slug>.png`, and set `coverAlt`.
3. `npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run build` — the same checks CI
   runs.
4. Push to `main`; Vercel deploys.

Set `draft: false` or it will not appear. `status` is
`live | in-progress | featured | concept`.

## Sites live under 1zero9.com

New sites take a subdomain — `<name>.1zero9.com` — on Cloudflare, where the
zone is. **Never deploy to the apex or `www`**: those serve the portfolio, and
taking them replaces it.

Attaching a Cloudflare custom domain creates the DNS record automatically;
there is nothing to add by hand.
